    <h1>Mood9 Business Card</h1> \
    <h2><a href="https://darienyoder.com/mood9">Check it out</a></h2> \
    <p>A friend of mine started his own film production company, titled "<a href="https://mood9.studio">mood9</a>," \
    so I offered to make him a website for it. Since the company was in its early stages \
    and hadn\'t yet produced anything, I didn\'t worry about appealing to potential audiences. \
    I instead designed it as a sort of interactive business card, \
    something you could scan off a QR code and quickly get the jist of what they do. \
    I put everything on one page and allowed navigation between subpages via snappy scrolling.</p> \
    <p>The owner decided during development that he would design the site himself using WordPress, \
    so it was never fully finished.</p> \

    <p>Summer of \'24, my friends and I competed in the 48 hour film project, \
    where you make a short film in a weekend based on a random genre, prop, character, and line of dialogue. \
    All of our locations fell through, so we had to build a set in the director\'s backyard. \
    We ended up winning 3rd best film in Cleveland, which inflated all our egos for a long while afterward.</p> \
    <ul> \
      <li>Genre: Tearjerker</li> \
      <li>Prop: Tomato</li> \

    <ol> \
      <li>I slipped on an acorn while on set and needed to be taken to urgent care to get stitches in my chin.</li> \
      <li>While the doctor was sowing my face back together, the lights flickered briefly. This turned out to be a city-wide power outage.</li> \
      <li>We had a generator to deal with the power outage, but because of how loud it was it needed to taken far down the trail and connected to all our lights by several extension cords.</li> \
      <li>A man on a bike threatened to break our camera because he thought we were filming him. The camera in question was not a camera, but rather a light bulb that was not pointed towards him.</li> \
      <li>While cleaning up after shooting in the pitch black of night, our producer tripped with 3 SD cards in his hand. When he stood up there were 2 SD cards in his hand.</li> \

    <p>This was the first project I got to be in the writer\'s room for. \
    My friend was preparing for her capstone project, \
    and decided that instead of a 10 minute short film she would shoot a 30 minute \
    TV pilot. We naively planned to make five episodes, but had to cut it down to only one \
    for time and budget reasons.</p> \

    <p>The folks at Brimfield Bread Oven were awesome. \
    They gave us the entire place to ourselves, \
    let us unplug the refridgerators while we were filming, \
    and offered us any cookies that were leftover from the past week. \
    Hearing the owner talk about his four-day workweek and coming in each morning \
    to the smell of cooked bread made me regret some of my own career choices.</p> \

    <h2><a href=\"https://dariengames.itch.io/21st-century-roguelike-pac-man\">Play it</a></h2> \
    <p>This was an attempt to ruin a beloved cultural icon by adding dozens of unnecessary features as a joke about directionless game development.</p> \
    <p>It gained some popularity after getting a mention in B3TA newsletter, which was then reposted by Andy Baio. \
    A little later it was reviewed on a few Spanish tech websites, which has kept daily traffic to the game \
    even two years later.</p> \

    <p>This was the first game I published. I\'d been playing around with Godot in the months prior, \
    making stupidly ambitious projects that I couldn\'t possibly finish. I decided to join a game jam \
    to force myself to actually finish something. This jam was special in that you were only allowed \
    three hours to work on the game. The theme was \"Empty World,\" so I thought it would be fun to make \
    a game with no visuals.</p> \
