    <p>This one should go in the game section, \
    but because this is a career portfolio it fits here as well.</p> \
    <p>In my college Software Engineering class, we split into groups \
    and made a small browser game to practice AGILE development. \
    I was the project manager on a team of 11 developers, managing our \
    burndown charts and leading the weekly standup meetings. \
    For the project itself, I made a custom scripting language \
    that my team used to rapidly create and iterate upon level designs. \
    The language performs boolean operations on primitive shapes \
    to create complex polygons. For example:</p> \
    <code> \
    // This creates a square with a circular hole in the center; <br> \
    ADD rect 0, 0, 100, 100; <br> \
    SUB circ 50, 50, 20; <br> \
    </code> \
    <p>There are some more advanced features like elevation and boolean order-of-operations. \
    The full documentation on the language can be found <a href="https://github.com/darienyoder/software-engineering-team-beta/blob/main/minigolf/HowToBuildLevels.md">here</a>.</p> \

    <p>A friend of mine started his own film production company, titled "<a href="https://mood9.studio">mood9</a>," \
    so I offered to make him a website for it. Since the company was in its early stages \
    and hadn\'t yet produced anything, I didn\'t worry about appealing to potential audiences. \
    I instead designed it as a sort of interactive business card, \
    something you could scan off a QR code and quickly get the jist of what they do. \
    I put everything on one page and allowed navigation between subpages via snappy scrolling.</p> \
    <p>The owner decided during development that he would design the site himself using WordPress, \
    so it was never fully finished.</p> \

      <li>A man on a bike threatened to break our camera because he thought we were filming him. The camera in question was not a camera, but rather a light bulb that was not pointed towards him.</li> \

    <p>I wrote this sketch after seeing a package at the grocery store titled "MANicure set," \
    which consisted of clippers and a black nail file.</p> \

    <p>This sketch was the first time any of us had tried shooting against a random wall \
    instead of the green screen or couch set. It\'s a little clunky, \
    but I think the dialogue is funny.</p> \

    <p>This one was nominated for a student Emmy, \
    which is impressive considering none of us could do the Pitbull voice right.</p> \

    <p>Will underdog Joe "Twiggy" Valdez beat reigning champion Buford the Obliterator? \
    Well, the thumbnail sort of gives it away. \
    We turned the studio into a wrestling ring for an episode \
    and made every sketch a wrestling match. \
    When our producer asked for a volunteer to get \
    battered around the ring nonstop for five minutes, \
    I knew my time had come.</p> \
