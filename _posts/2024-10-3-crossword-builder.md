# My cousins won't stop having kids

Back in 2015, my uncle made a scrabble board featuring the names of everyone in our family, gluing each letter in place so that every name connected to another, all rooting from the phrase "YODER FAMILY" at the top. It's hung from the wall in my grandma's kitchen above her cat's water bowl. Nine years and five cousins later, we now needed an update.

Long story short, no one could figure it out, and we were all debating how we could shorten names or exclude certain family members to have enough space. Online crossword generators were tried, but while all of them could put together a crossword with every name included, none could do so within the 15x15 grid of a scrabble board, and as far as I could find, there was no way to set such a limit. Since other people's tools weren't working out, I decided to make my own.
