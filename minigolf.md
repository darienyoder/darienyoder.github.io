<!-- ## Overview -->

This was a university project to practice developing software using AGILE methodology. We made a little minigolf game that runs in the browser. I was project manager on a team of 11 developers and handled our Kanban board and burndown charts. I also created a scripting language to help expedite the process of building levels.
