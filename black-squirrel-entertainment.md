# Black Squirrel Entertainment is Kent State's streaming platform for TV and radio. In my last year of college I built them a web app to distribute their content.<br>[BlackSquirrelRadio.com](https://blacksquirrelradio.com)

## Background

When I started college I joined a small sketch comedy show as a fun way to spend my time between classes. As a side effect I got very involved with the student broadcasting station as a whole. At the start of my senior year, the TV Entertainment department was restructured and merged with the [student radio station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Squirrel_Radio) to form a new organization: Black Squirrel Entertainment. With this, I applied to be the website manager for the new organization, and was tasked with redesigning their website.

## Key Problems

1. The site needed to handle both the college's TV and Radio livestreams.
2. The livestreams are handled through a third-party service, which made it difficult to fully integrate them with the site.
3. The TV department has a 24/7 schedule that has never been seen by the public.
4. The old site had been made with WordPress, which is very inconvenient for coding everything yourself, but for the sake of allowing other members of the organization to maintain their current workflows for publishing content, I did not want to completely remove that.
5. I would probably be the last Web Manager for a long time who understands PHP and MySQL, which means that I needed an easy way for future managers to update the site and understand how it works.
