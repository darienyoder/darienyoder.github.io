# [Check it out](/mood9)

A friend of mine started his own film production company, titled "mood9," so I offered to make him a website for it. Since the company was in its early stages and hadn't yet produced anything, I didn't worry about appealing to potential audiences. I instead designed it as a sort of interactive business card, something you could scan off a QR code and quickly get the jist of what they do. I put everything on one page and allowed navigation between subpages via snappy scrolling. The link's up there if you want to check it out.
